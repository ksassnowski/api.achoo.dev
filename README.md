# ðŸŒ» Achoo â€“ Pollen Forecast API for Germany

This is the source code for the API server running over at [https://api.achoo.dev](https://api.achoo.dev). Check out the documentation at [https://achoo.dev](https://achoo.dev).

## Where is the data coming from?

The API is using data provided by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). The raw data can be found [here](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/health/alerts/s31fg.json). Basically all I'm doing is slightly changing the format and providing endpoints to query only parts of the data.
